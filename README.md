#Good ideas I think I had:
- For the flag management, I stored the flag then dereferenced the pointer and called the flag management function again
- To store the list: I used one table of int who has the size of the list, and then when I pa or pb, I just have to move the separation between the two lists by one. Fast and easy for the compilation
